  <p>The data above is from the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/publications">FBI</a> </p>

    <p>This bar graph shows the amount of murders that took place in California, New York, and Illinois from the years 2015 - 2019. Because these are among the most populous states in the United States, the data is a good representation of murders in metropolitan cities during the time span. As can be seen by the graph, it is clear that in the year 2016, there was a spike in all three states. The spike in murders in 2016 could potentially be related to the fact that it was an election year. From 2015 -2016, California had 69 more murders, Illinois had 300 more murders and New York had 17 more murders.</p>

    <p>The data above is from the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-20">FBI</a> </p>


    <p>The bar graph above shows the distribution of weapons used in California, New York, and Illinois 2019. By analyzing the graph, firearms are undeniably the most common weapon that is being used in metropolitan areas. This is shown on a huge scale when looking at the data from a large state like California. When compared to the use of knives as weapons, California had almost 5 times the amount of firearm use when compared to knives and nearly 12 times the amount of firearm use in comparison with other weapons. Being that it is an election year and crime tends to skyrocket (especially in metropolitan areas) during these times, stricter enforcement and regulation of firearm purchases would be well advised.</p>
